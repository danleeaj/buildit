## Overview

A playful, warm B2B SaaS design system built on a **cream-tinted white canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — #fffaf0) with dark-navy ink type and **3D-rendered illustrations** (mountains, characters, peach/ochre/lavender landscapes) as the dominant brand voltage. Where most data-platform brands lean cool with grids and gradients, this system leans into hand-crafted-looking 3D illustrations and saturated single-color feature cards.

Type voice runs **Inter weight 500** with negative letter-spacing — used at large display sizes (72px hero) for a rounded, warm feel without needing heavier weights. Body type uses Inter at standard weights.

Component voltage comes from **saturated single-color feature cards** in a 6-color palette: hot pink, deep teal, lavender, peach, ochre, and cream-card. Each card shows product UI fragments at small scale — agent runs, sequencer flows, enrichment outputs. The colored card IS the primary visual element on every long-scroll page.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cream-tinted white canvas (`{colors.canvas}` — #fffaf0). The warmth differentiates from cool-gray competitor sites.
- Dark navy/black primary CTAs (`{colors.primary}` — #0a0a0a). Buttons rounded `{rounded.md}` (12px) — friendly modern but not pill.
- 6-color saturated feature card palette: `{colors.brand-pink}`, `{colors.brand-teal}`, `{colors.brand-lavender}`, `{colors.brand-peach}`, `{colors.brand-ochre}`, `{colors.surface-card}` (cream).
- 3D illustrations (mountains, characters, abstract shapes) as full-bleed hero artifacts — the brand's most-recognized visual element.
- Inter display typeface at 500 weight with -1 to -2.5px letter-spacing on display sizes.
- Border radius is generous: `{rounded.md}` (12px) for buttons + inputs, `{rounded.lg}` (16px) for content cards, `{rounded.xl}` (24px) for feature cards. The bigger radius matches the rounded type character.
- Product UI fragments embedded inside colored cards at small scale — agent run logs, sequencer flows, enrichment results.
- Section rhythm `{spacing.section}` (96px) between major bands.
- Footer is cream-tinted (`{colors.surface-soft}`) — does NOT use a dark footer. Even the closing band stays warm-light.

## Typography

### Font Family
The system runs **Inter** for all type. Display headlines use Inter at weight 500 with negative letter-spacing for a softer, rounded feel. Body, navigation, and UI use Inter at standard weights. The fallback stack is `Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 72px | 500 | 1.0 | -2.5px | Homepage h1 |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 56px | 500 | 1.05 | -2px | Section heads |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 40px | 500 | 1.1 | -1px | Sub-section heads, product names |
| `{typography.display-sm}` | 32px | 500 | 1.15 | -0.5px | CTA-band heads, feature card titles |
| `{typography.title-lg}` | 24px | 600 | 1.3 | -0.3px | Pricing plan names, larger feature titles |
| `{typography.title-md}` | 18px | 600 | 1.4 | 0 | Card titles, intro paragraphs |
| `{typography.title-sm}` | 16px | 600 | 1.4 | 0 | Small card titles, list labels |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default running-text |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Footer body, fine-print |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Badge labels, captions |
| `{typography.caption-uppercase}` | 12px | 600 | 1.4 | 1.5px | Section labels, "FEATURED" badges |
| `{typography.button}` | 14px | 600 | 1.0 | 0 | Standard button labels |
| `{typography.nav-link}` | 14px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Top-nav menu items |

### Principles
Inter at weight 500 + negative letter-spacing IS the display voice. Going to weight 700 reads as bombastic; the lighter weight adds warmth that bolder weight would flatten.

The display-vs-body split is functional: display sizes get weight 500 with tight tracking for presence, body sizes get weight 400 with standard tracking for readability.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit:** 4px.
- **Tokens:** `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.xxl}` 48px · `{spacing.section}` 96px.
- **Section padding:** `{spacing.section}` (96px) between major editorial bands.
- **Card internal padding:** `{spacing.xl}` (32px) for feature cards and pricing tiers; `{spacing.lg}` (24px) for testimonial and product mockup cards.

### Grid & Container
- **Max content width:** ~1280px centered.
- **Editorial body:** Single 12-column grid; hero often uses 7/5 split (h1 left, illustration right).
- **Feature card grids:** 3-up at desktop, 2-up at tablet, 1-up at mobile.
- **Pricing grid:** 3-4 up at desktop, 1-up at mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy
Generous whitespace around big display headlines and saturated feature cards. The cream canvas + colored cards + 3D illustrations create a playful warmth that competing data-platform sites lack.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | No shadow, no border | Body sections, top nav, hero |
| Soft hairline | 1px `{colors.hairline}` border | Inputs, small content cards |
| Saturated card | Brand pink/teal/lavender/peach/ochre fill — no shadow | Feature cards |
| Cream card | `{colors.surface-card}` background — no shadow | Testimonial, secondary cards |
| Subtle drop shadow | Faint shadow at low alpha | Hover-elevated states (rare) |

The system uses no heavy shadows. Depth comes from the saturated color contrast between cream canvas and bright feature cards.

### Decorative Depth
- **3D illustrations** — mountains, characters, mascots rendered in a hand-crafted 3D style. The brand's most-recognized depth element. Not a token — these are illustrated assets.
- **Mascot characters** appear as inline figures in feature cards and CTAs.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 6px | Small badges, dropdown items |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 8px | Small buttons, hairline-border accent |
| `{rounded.md}` | 12px | Standard CTA buttons, text inputs |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 16px | Content cards, testimonial cards, pricing tiers |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 24px | Feature cards (the saturated brand-color cards) |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Category tabs, badge pills |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px / 50% | Avatars, icon buttons |

## Components

### Top Navigation

**`top-nav`** — Cream nav bar pinned to top. 64px tall, `{colors.canvas}` background. Logo + wordmark at left, primary horizontal menu center, right-side cluster with "Sign in" + "Get started" `{component.button-primary}`. Menu items in `{typography.nav-link}` (Inter 14px / 500).

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Background `{colors.primary}` (near-black), text `{colors.on-primary}` (white), type `{typography.button}` (Inter 14px / 600), padding 12px × 20px, height 44px, rounded `{rounded.md}` (12px).

**`button-secondary`** — Cream button with hairline outline. Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, 1px hairline border.

**`button-on-color`** — White button used over saturated brand-color feature cards. Same shape as primary but inverted (white background, ink text).

**`button-text-link`** — Inline text button, no background. Used for "Sign in" and inline link CTAs.

**`text-link`** — Inline body links in `{colors.ink}` with underline.

### Cards & Containers

**`hero-band`** — Cream-canvas hero with 7-5 grid: h1 + sub-headline + button row on the left, 3D illustration on the right. Vertical padding `{spacing.section}` (96px).

**`hero-illustration-card`** — Right-side artifact holding 3D illustration (mountains, characters, abstract shapes). Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, rounded `{rounded.xl}` (24px). The illustration IS the artifact.

**`feature-card-pink`** / **`feature-card-teal`** / **`feature-card-lavender`** / **`feature-card-peach`** / **`feature-card-ochre`** — Saturated single-color feature cards. Background varies per variant; rounded `{rounded.xl}` (24px); padding `{spacing.xl}` (32px). Each card carries an h3 in `{typography.title-md}`, a body description, and a product UI fragment or illustration. Text color flips to `{colors.on-dark}` (white) on pink and teal cards, `{colors.ink}` (dark) on lavender/peach/ochre cards (the lighter saturations have enough contrast for dark text).

**`feature-card-cream`** — Lower-key feature card variant on `{colors.surface-card}`. Used for less-emphasized features that don't warrant a saturated color.

**`product-mockup-card`** — Card showing actual product UI (agent runs, sequencer flows, enrichment tables). Background `{colors.canvas}` with hairline border, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.lg}` (24px).

**`testimonial-card`** — Customer quote cards. Background `{colors.surface-card}` (cream), rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.lg}` (24px). Top row has avatar + name + role; below sits the testimonial in `{typography.body-md}`.

**`pricing-tier-card`** — Standard tier card. Background `{colors.canvas}` with hairline, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.xl}` (32px).

**`pricing-tier-card-featured`** — The featured tier flips to `{colors.brand-teal}` (deep teal-green). The teal surface IS the featured signal.

**`expert-card`** — Background `{colors.canvas}` with hairline, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.lg}`. Carries an avatar at top, name, specialization, and a "Book session" link.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, rounded `{rounded.md}` (12px), padding 12px × 16px, height 44px. 1px hairline border.

**`text-input-focused`** — Border thickens to ink for emphasis.

### Tabs / Badges

**`category-tab`** + **`category-tab-active`** — Pill-shaped tabs in sub-nav. Inactive: transparent + muted text. Active: cream-card background + ink text. Padding 8px × 16px.

**`badge-pill`** — Small cream-fill pill labels in `{typography.caption}` (13px / 500), rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### CTA / Footer

**`cta-band-illustrated`** — Pre-footer CTA band. Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, rounded `{rounded.xl}`, padding 80px. Carries an h2 in `{typography.display-md}`, a sub-line, and a `{component.button-primary}` — usually paired with a 3D illustration.

**`footer`** — Cream-tinted footer (NOT dark). Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.body}`. 4-column link list. Vertical padding 80px.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Anchor every page on the cream canvas (`{colors.canvas}` — #fffaf0). The warm tint differentiates from cool-gray data sites.
- Use 3D illustrations as hero artifacts. Hand-crafted 3D characters and mountains ARE the brand.
- Cycle saturated feature cards across the page — pink → teal → lavender → peach → ochre → cream. Repeating the same color twice in a row reads as off-rhythm.
- Use Inter at weight 500 with negative letter-spacing on every display headline.
- Show product UI fragments inside saturated feature cards. The brand voltage is product-driven, not abstract.
- Use cream footer (NOT dark). Deliberately close pages with warm cream rather than the standard dark-footer template.
- Anchor every band with `{spacing.section}` (96px) vertical rhythm.

### Don't
- Don't use cool grays for canvas. The cream tint is non-negotiable.
- Don't use a 7th brand-color card. The 6-color palette is saturated enough.
- Don't bold display weight beyond 500. Inter at 700 for display reads as bombastic.
- Don't repeat the same brand-color card twice in a row.
- Don't replace 3D illustrations with flat vector art. The hand-crafted 3D character IS the brand voice.
- Don't use a dark footer. The cream footer is part of the system's warm-throughout pacing.
- Don't add hover state styling beyond what the system already encodes.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 768px | Hamburger nav; hero h1 72→36px; hero-illustration-card stacks below; feature grids 1-up; pricing 1-up |
| Tablet | 768–1024px | Top nav tightens; feature cards 2-up; pricing 2-up |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Full top-nav; 3-up feature cards; 3-up pricing tiers |
| Wide | > 1440px | Same as desktop with more breathing room; max content 1280px |

### Touch Targets
- `{component.button-primary}` at minimum 44 × 44px (matches WCAG AAA).
- `{component.text-input}` height is 44px.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger at < 768px.
- Hero 7-5 grid → single-column on mobile.
- Feature card grids reduce columns rather than scaling.
- Saturated feature cards retain their colored fill at every breakpoint.
- Pricing tier cards collapse 4 → 2 → 1.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time. Reference its key (`{component.feature-card-pink}`, `{component.pricing-tier-card-featured}`).
2. Pick the right brand-color card for the feature: pink for outbound/sequencer, teal for enterprise/featured, lavender for AI-agent products, peach for general warmth, ochre for community / experts.
3. Variants of an existing component (`-active`, `-disabled`) live as separate entries.
4. Use `{token.refs}` everywhere — never inline hex.
5. Never document hover.
6. Display headlines stay Inter 500 with negative letter-spacing. Body stays Inter 400.
7. The cream-throughout palette is a system contract — don't add a dark footer.

## Known Gaps

- 3D illustrations are commissioned assets, not system tokens — they're rendered per-page.
- Mascot characters (recurring illustrated figures) are illustrated assets; their exact naming is not formalized in tokens.
- Animation and transition timings (illustration parallax on scroll, feature card entrance animations) are not in scope.
- Form validation states beyond `{component.text-input-focused}` are not extracted.
